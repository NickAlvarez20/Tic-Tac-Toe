## Project Name
Tic-Tac-Toe (React Edition)

## About
This is a clean, beginner-friendly implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **React** and **Vite**.  

It follows the official React tutorial structure (or a very similar pattern), demonstrating core React concepts through a fun, interactive project:  
- Functional components  
- useState for managing game state  
- Passing props between components  
- Handling clicks and game logic  
- Lifting state up  
- Immutability with arrays  
- Conditional rendering (winner display, status, etc.)

Perfect for anyone starting their React journey — from understanding JSX to building interactive UIs.

## Prerequisites
To run this project you need:

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) and **npm** (or **yarn** / **pnpm**) installed.

No global libraries required — all dependencies are managed via npm.

## Features
This Tic-Tac-Toe game includes these key features:
- Classic 3x3 grid gameplay (X vs O)
- Turn-based play with status indicator ("Next player: X" / "Winner: O" / "Draw")
- Click-to-place moves
- Winner detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection
- Clean, responsive UI with minimal styling
- Lightning-fast development with Vite + Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- ESLint for code quality

## Getting Started & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
2. Navigate into the project:
   ```bash
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
## Usage
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
2. Open http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port) in your browser to play!
3. To create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
4. Preview the build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview

# How to Play
* Click any empty square to place your mark (X starts first)
* Alternate turns until someone gets 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or the board is full (draw)
* Enjoy the game!
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
* Master React component composition and props drilling
* Understand state management with useState in a multi-component app
* Learn how to handle events and update UI immutably
* Practice deriving game state (winner calculation, next player)
* Get comfortable with Vite as a fast alternative to Create React App
* Build my first fully interactive React application from scratch
## Contributing


This is mainly a personal learning/portfolio project, so formal contributions aren't expected. That said, if you'd like to add features (restart button, move history, AI opponent, score tracking, better styling, dark mode, etc.), feel free to:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/restart-button)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add game restart functionality')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/restart-button)
5. Open a Pull Request

Keep changes educational and beginner-friendly!
